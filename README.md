## About

First things to know about \<T\>LAPACK:

1. We write &nbsp; \<T\>LAPACK &nbsp; whenever it is possible. This includes all software documentation, discussions, and presentation.
2. We say it &nbsp; T-L-A-PACK &nbsp; .
3. We use &nbsp; `tlapack` &nbsp; for files, folders, and links, to make it more portable and easier to use.

\<T\>LAPACK provides:

+ Precision-neutral function template implementation

*Supported in part by [NSF ACI 2004850](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2004850).*

## Installation

\<T\>LAPACK is built and installed with [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

### Getting CMake

You can either download binaries for the [latest stable](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) or [previous](https://cmake.org/download/#previous) release of CMake,
or build the [current development distribution](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake) from source. CMake is also available in the APT repository on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher.

### Building and Installing \<T\>LAPACK

\<T\>LAPACK can be build following the standard CMake recipe

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -B build -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install . # configuration step
cmake --build build                  # build step
cmake --build build --target install # install step
```

### CMake options

Standard environment variables affect CMake.
Some examples are

    CXX                 C++ compiler
    CXXFLAGS            C++ compiler flags
    LDFLAGS             linker flags

The Fortran and C wrappers to \<T\>LAPACK also use, among others,

    CC                  C compiler
    CFLAGS              C compiler flags
    FC                  Fortran compiler
    FFLAGS              Fortran compiler flags

* [This page](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-env-variables.7.html) lists the environment variables that have special meaning to CMake.

It is also possible to pass variables to CMake during the configuration step using the `-D` flag.
The following example builds \<T\>LAPACK in debug mode inside the directory `build`

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
cmake --build build
```

* [This page](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html) documents variables that are provided by CMake or have meaning to CMake when set by project code.

        Type of all non size-related integers in libtlapack_c, libtlapack_cblas, and libtlapack_fortran. It is the type
        used for the array increments, e.g., incx and incy.
